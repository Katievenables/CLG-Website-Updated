        <h2>The 17 Best Cream Eyeshadows For When 
            You Are Too Lazy To Use A Brush </h2>

            <p>
                A truly ingenious invention, cream eyeshadows are the kind of eye makeup that can be easily applied and blended with your fingers, which means no expensive brushes are required. They're also available in a myriad of formats: dip pots, squeezable tubes, and our personal favourite, eyeshadow sticks, which makes swiping on the dreamy cream formulas a certified cakewalk. They're also made to last; most cream eyeshadow formulas dry down after application, reducing the risk of smudging, creasing or fading throughout the day.

            <h2>Help! I Hate My Best Friends Partner</h2>
            <p>
                There are three guarantees in life: death, taxes, and at least one of your friends dating someone you don’t like. Maybe your friend’s partner is pretentious, or blunt to the point of rudeness, or they make fatphobic or racist or sexist comments that bother you, or maybe they’re just downright unpleasant. Either way, we’ve all been there. And while you may be getting the secondhand ick, know that this — however unfortunate — is a common experience. But when do we, if ever, get the go ahead to confront our friends over their controversial partner?

        <p>Right now, you might be searching for the movie equivalent of a weighted blanket – comforting, familiar, classic, and one that definitely doesn’t mention the terms ‘cost of living crisis,’ ‘environmental disaster’ or ‘Elon Musk.’ Well, this list has got you covered, because it’s some of the best movies made in the 90s.</p>

            <h2>TikTok’s ‘Man Repelling Fashion’ & ‘Ugly Beauty’ Trends Show That We’re Officially Done With The Male Gaze</h2>

            <img src="/Images/uglyfashion.webp" width="300" height="400">

            <p>
                TikTok's 'Tomato Girl' aesthetic and glowy golden hour makeup belong to the club of natural, traditionally pretty style and beauty trends that always seem to have a place in the wider cultural conversation. But what is a bit of a headscratcher is the emerging popularity of trends that seem to throw all of those traditions and conventional beauty standards out the window. #UglyBeauty has amassed 13.7 million views on TikTok and is projected to be one of the biggest emerging beauty trends on the app this year. Similarly, in the world of style, #ManRepeller aesthetic (not to be confused with the now-defunct publication with the same name) has garnered 4.8 million views on TikTok.
