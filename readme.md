# Magazine style website for CLG

I made this website as part of the Code Like A girl Introduction to Web Development course. My aim was to make a website with fashion, beauty and lifestyle elements and I was inspired by the website Refinery 29.

# Features

The HTML structure consists of a header, main content area with multiple sections for different stories, and a footer.
Each story section contains an article with a title, image, and content related to various topics such as fashion, beauty, lifestyle.
Additionally, there is a main section with a grid layout displaying tiles featuring beauty-related topics.

# Navigation

The navigation bar in the header allows users to navigate between different sections of the website, including fashion, beauty, lifestyle, and signup pages.
The website logo serves as a link to the homepage.

# Sign-up Form

The signup form allows users to subscribe to the newsletter. It includes fields for the user's name, email address, preferred newsletter frequency, and a text area for preferred content.
Users can select their preferred frequency (daily or weekly) using radio buttons.
Terms and conditions checkbox is provided for users to agree before signing up.

# Styling

The website layout is responsive and adjusts according to different screen sizes.
Custom fonts from Google Fonts are used for typography.
The color scheme and design elements aim for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
